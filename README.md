# Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph

## Overview
This project is a visual representation of cycling data using a scatterplot graph. The scatterplot graph is a type of plot using Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables from a set of data. This project is built with D3.js, a JavaScript library for producing dynamic and interactive data visualizations in web browsers.

The dataset used in this project is a JSON file from freeCodeCamp that provides information about different cyclists, including the year, time, and any doping allegations.

## Running the Project
To run this project locally, you can clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: This file includes the HTML structure of the project and links to the required D3.js library.
- `style.css`: This file contains all the CSS styles used in the project.
- `index.js`: This file contains the JavaScript and D3.js code to fetch the data, create scales, draw the scatterplot graph, and generate the axes.

## Features
- The scatterplot graph shows performance times of various cyclists and differentiates between cyclists with and without doping allegations.
- When the mouse hovers over a point in the graph, a tooltip appears showing more information about the cyclist.
